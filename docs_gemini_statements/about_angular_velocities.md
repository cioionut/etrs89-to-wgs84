Angular velocity refers to the rate of rotation of an object around an axis. Here, it describes the speed and direction of how Eurasia is spinning in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) for a specific year (represented by "yy").

Imagine Earth as a giant ball, and Eurasia as a smaller plate fixed on it. Angular velocity tells you how fast and in which direction the Eurasian plate is rotating on Earth. It's not spinning around its own center, but rather rotating relative to a fixed reference point within the Earth.

Here's a breakdown of the key terms:

* **Angular:**  This refers to rotation around an axis, as opposed to linear motion in a straight line.

* **Velocity:** This combines the speed of rotation (how fast) and the direction of rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise).

* **Eurasia:** This is the tectonic plate that covers most of Europe and Asia.

* **ITRF_yy:** This refers to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame for a specific year, denoted by "yy". The ITRF is a global reference frame for Earth, and each year a new realization is created to account for tiny shifts in the Earth's crust.

So, the statement is saying that if you measure Eurasia's rotation in three directions (likely east-west, north-south, and up-down), the values you get are essentially the three components of how quickly Eurasia is spinning relative to a fixed point in the Earth for that particular year (represented by "yy" in ITRF_yy).
